# üöÄ **Instant Prototype Data with MCP Anchor + Synthetic Dataset**

Get realistic payment data in your prototype with **2 simple Cursor prompts** - no configuration needed.

## **One-Line Setup**

```bash
npx mcp-anchor init --with-dataset
```

This automatically:
‚úÖ Downloads the [synthetic-dataset](https://github.com/swanson-stripe/synthetic-dataset) repository  
‚úÖ Configures MCP server with persona switching  
‚úÖ Sets up API endpoints with realistic business data  
‚úÖ Provides Cursor with ready-to-use prompts

## **Cursor Prompts (Copy & Paste)**

### **Prompt 1: Add Dataset to Your App**

```
Use MCP Anchor to add realistic synthetic data to my React app. I want:
- Customer list with realistic names and details
- Revenue metrics and payment data  
- Business: [modaic/mindora/keynest/pulseon/fluxly/brightfund/procura/stratus/forksy]
- Stage: [early/growth/mature]

Set up the API client boundary and show the data in components.
```

### **Prompt 2: Switch Business Scenarios**  

```
Switch my app to use [business_name] data at [stage] stage. Update the components to show:
- Different customer patterns
- Industry-specific metrics
- Realistic transaction volumes for this business type

Keep the same UI structure but with new realistic data.
```

    business: 'modaic',  // Fashion e-commerce
    stage: 'growth'      // Scaling phase
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <MetricCards data={metrics} />
      <CustomerList customers={customers} />
      <RevenueChart transactions={transactions} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
